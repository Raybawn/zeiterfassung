A simple time management tool as a project for my studies in software engineering for which about 16 hours were planned.
Written in **Java** with **JavaFX** for the graphical user interface.

The program allows to record and assign problems to the respective customers. The time is stopped and rounded up to the next quarter of an hour.

In the overview all customers and their problems can be listed and checked off, e.g. as soon as they have been entered in the company's own ticketing system.

The project was interesting and I was able to learn an incredible amount. JavaFX needs some time to get used to, but then it runs smoothly.
